# Returnables

Adds the `/return` command that you can use in a function to cancel the commands after it. And of course, you can use it in `/execute`. The result is 1 when ran inside a function and 0 when not.

## Caution

Currently, this is an experimental mod, intended just for playing with the idea. It may not be updated in the future.
